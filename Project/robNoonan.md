I chose issue #13 https://github.com/gzdwsu/RaiderPlanner/issues/13

It dealt with making RaiderPlanner’s webpage more accessible to visually impaired and general cleanup of the html code itself.
 What I accomplished was adding alt tags to the image tags in the html. This allows for audio of what that image is when a cursor scrolls over the image.
 Along with these changes to image tags. I also removed an abundant amount of redundant code.
 This most likely was from when the page was getting planned and the web developer just never decided to remove it.

Commit Comments: These commits worked pretty well. None of the code I submitted comflicted with anything else. 
This is a given considering that the webpage is separate from the application itself.
